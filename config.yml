# **all of the above is completely optional**, and you can use https://qr.chasa.wtf/ completely for free
# if you want to use your own domain: (if you get stuck, search for "cloudflare pages tutorial" on youtube, im sure you can figure it out)
#  1. get https://qr.chasa.wtf/ source code (visit the site -> right click -> View page source -> Copy all of the text)
#  2. create a github repo, and upload and save the code with the file name index.html
#  3. go to dash.cloudflare.com, and select your account
#  4. once you are logged in and your url looks something like: https://dash.cloudflare.com/8638747a12f04d0cb759842352cc38c7
#     add "/pages/new/provider/github" to the end of it, so its like: https://dash.cloudflare.com/8638747a12f04d0cb759842352cc38c7/pages/new/provider/github
#  5. if this is your first time, you need to log into github.
#  6. when thats done, select the repository that you made earlier, and click Begin Setup
#  7. leave all the settings as they are, and click Save and Deploy.
#  8. wait until thats deployed.
#  9. you now have a pages.dev link. if you want your own domain, keep on following along
# 10. scroll down, and click Continue to project
# 11. click Custom domains then Set up a custom domain
# 12. enter your domain (doesnt have to be on cloudflare), and click continue
# 13. if your domain is on cloudflare, then you dont need to mess around with custom DNS, just click Activate domain
# 14. if your domain isnt on cloudflare, then go to your DNS settings for that domain (on namecheap, or wherever you bought that domain), and add the correct DNS settings
# 15. your website should now be online! it can sometimes take a few hours for your DNS settings to update, so just be patient.
